          Hi! I'm your PayPal Assistant and always here to help.<br>
          I'm still in beta testing, so talking to you helps me learn.
        </p>
        <p>If I can't then I'll try to transfer you to a Customer Support Agent.</p>

      Good day!
      <p>Thanks for reaching out to PayPal. How can I help you today?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble user">
      What is my instant monthly release limit without money going on hold?
    </div>

    <!-- ASSISTANT RESPONSE -->
    <div class="assistant-text">
      <p>Thanks for your question. I&rsquo;ll be happy to explain how instant monthly release limits work.</p>

      <p>
        Since your account shows a strong selling history, consistent transaction activity,
        and a positive track record with buyers, PayPal generally does not place routine
        payment holds on your incoming funds.
      </p>

      <p>For established and trusted sellers like you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Payments are typically available instantly</li>
        <li>Holds are not required under normal circumstances</li>
        <li>A monthly instant release threshold applies instead of standard holds</li>
        <li>Funds continue to be released automatically as payments are received</li>
        <li>Your account meets PayPal&rsquo;s reliability criteria</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once your monthly instant release limit is reached, additional payments may be
        temporarily reviewed.
      </p>

      <p>
        To confirm your exact monthly limit, I&rsquo;ll need to transfer you to a
        Customer Support Agent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble user">Ok</div>

    <div class="assistant-text">
      <p>I can transfer this conversation to an agent. Our reply may take a few hours.</p>
      <p>Once I transfer this conversation, you may close this window and return to it when you can.</p>
      <p>Would you link to send this conversation to a customer support agent?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble user">Yes</div>

    <div class="assistant-text">
      <p>
        An agent will review your request and respond to you in the PayPal Message Center during normal business hours.
        You’ll receive a notification as soon as a reply is available.
        Thank you for your patience while we connect you with a support specialist.

        <p>Hello, My name is Stephen, and I’ll be assisting you today.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your patience while the chat was transferred. I’ve taken a few moments to carefully review the conversation you had with our PayPal Assistant, including your question about your instant monthly release limit and your account history.</p>
        <p>Please allow me another moment while I check your account details thoroughly.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble user">Sure, no problem.</div>

    <div class="agent-message">
      <div class="agent-badge">S</div>

      <div class="assistant-text">
        <p>Thank you for waiting.</p>
        <p>I’ve now reviewed your account activity, sales performance, and overall standing with PayPal. I can confirm that your account is classified as a long-standing, trusted seller with:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A consistent transaction history</li>
        <li>No recent limitations</li>
        <li>No dispute and chargeback activity</li>
        <li>Verified and confirmed account information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because of this, PayPal does not apply standard payment holds to your incoming funds.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="agent-message">
      <div class="agent-badge">S</div>

      <div class="assistant-text">
        <p>Regarding your question about your instant monthly release limit:</p>
        <p>Your current monthly instant release limit is:</p>
        <p>USD 310,000</p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You can receive up to 310,000 USD per month with instant access to funds</li>
        <li>Payments within this limit will not be placed on hold</li>
        <li>Funds are available immediately to your PayPal balance</li>
        <li>The limit resets automatically at the start of each month</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only if this limit is exceeded would additional payments be subject to review, which is standard for all high-volume sellers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble user">Great, thanks for confirming that.</div>

    <div class="agent-message">
      <div class="agent-badge">S</div>

      <div class="assistant-text">
        <p>You’re very welcome!</p>
        <p>If you continue operating as you have been, your account will remain in good standing, and you may also be eligible for future limit reviews if your volume increases.</p>
        <p>Is there anything else I can help you with today?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble user">No, that’s all.</div>

    <div class="agent-message">
      <div class="agent-badge">S</div>

      <div class="assistant-text">
        <p>Perfect. Thank you for choosing PayPal, and we appreciate your continued business.
Have a great day!</p>
